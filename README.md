# Vehicle-Coupon-Recommendation

In todayâ€™s competitive retail and service market, companies frequently distribute coupons to attract and retain customers. However, sending the same coupons to all customers often results in low redemption rates and wasted marketing spend. To maximize impact, businesses need to deliver personalized offers that match customer preferences and context.

This project explores a vehicle coupon recommendation dataset to address this challenge. The goal is to predict whether a driver will accept a coupon (e.g., coffee shop, restaurant, bar) based on demographic information (age, income, marital status) and situational context (time of day, weather, passenger type, weekday vs. weekend). By applying data science techniques, I built predictive models to identify the factors that influence coupon acceptance.

The results provide actionable insights for businesses:

1. Bar coupons are most attractive to young adults traveling with friends on weekends.
2. Coffee coupons perform best for commuters during weekday mornings.
3. Family restaurant coupons are more likely accepted by drivers with children on weekends.

By targeting the right customers with the right coupons, companies can **increase redemption rates, reduce marketing costs, and improve customer satisfaction**.
